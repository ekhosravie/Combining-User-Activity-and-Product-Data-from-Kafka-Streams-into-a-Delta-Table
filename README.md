Combining User Activity and Product Data from Kafka Streams into a Delta Table
Scenario:
Imagine an e-commerce platform where user interactions with products are captured in one Kafka topic (topic1) and detailed product information resides in another (topic2). 
This code continuously processes these streams, combines them based on a common "item_id" field, and stores the enriched data in a Delta table for further analysis.
Technical Brief:
Structured Streaming: Leverages Apache Spark's Structured Streaming API to efficiently process continuous data streams from Kafka topics.
Schema Definition: Employs well-defined schemas (using StructType) for both topics, ensuring data structure consistency.
Error Handling: Includes custom deserialization functions (deserialize_topic1 and deserialize_topic2) to handle potential parsing errors gracefully. Faulty messages are routed to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) topic (dlq-topic) for further investigation.
Delta Lake Integration: Writes the joined stream to a Delta table, enabling efficient storage, schema evolution, and time travel capabilities for historical data analysis.
Micro-Batch Processing: Utilizes micro-batch processing with configurable checkpointing for reliable and scalable data ingestion.
Key Improvements:
Descriptive Title: Highlights the use of multiple Kafka topics.
Clear Scenario: Provides a relatable e-commerce use case.
Technical Breakdown: Explains the functionalities and benefits of each code section.
